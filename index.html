<div class="float-image-left fil-about"><img src="/assets/images/paul-1.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></div>

<p>I’m a 68-year-old retired computer programmer. To keep my mind active, I’ve decided to start a blog. It’s mainly about photography, maths and programming, but will also contain posts about my travels and the various other things I get up to.</p>

<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to use them in this blog (though there are issues doing this, see this <a href="/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">post</a>).</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR, a Cannon EOS 400D with an 18 to 55mm zoom lens. It’s getting very old now, but it still works, and unless I win the lottery, I can’t afford a new one. I also use my mobile phone, an Oscal model C80. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, its open source and free.</p>

<div class="float-image-right fir-about"><img src="/assets/images/paul-edge-hill-1977.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station 1977" /></div>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<p>I’ve always been interested in maths.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree, the maths got very interesting and difficult (in the third year we covered waves crashing into beaches, I gave up there!). It’s almost 50 years since I finished the degree, I’ve forgotten most of it.</p>

<p>In 1971 I took my ‘O’ level maths, I still have one of the papers. When thinking about what to blog about, I thought I would publish it on this blog and write about re-learning the maths necessary to answer the questions. Unfortunately, I cannot get permission to publish it, <strong>even though it is over 50 years old!</strong></p>

<p>I’ve decided I’m still going to blog about maths, but I’m going to blog about the bits that interest me. Starting with numbers and algebra, working up to Calculus. More about this <a href="/maths">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been a programmer all my life. I guess most people are not interested in programming, so more about this <a href="/computers">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will also contain posts about my travels and the various other things that I get up to, that interest me.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog">blog page</a> lists all my posts, latest first.</p>

<p>All my posts have been tagged; the tags are listed <a href="/blog/tags">here</a>. All tags have been categorised by photography, travel, maths, computers and miscellaneous. Hopefully, this will make it easier to locate posts that might interest you.</p>
