<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box full of slides and prints. I was going to convert them to digital images. But, after talking to someone at a local photo club, I decided it was impractical. They told me it takes too long, and the results are not always good. Almost everyone in the club decided that converting film images to digital was a non-starter.</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR, a Cannon EOS 400D with a 18 to 55mm zoom lens. It’s getting old now, but it still works, and unless I win the lottery, I can’t afford a new one. I also use my mobile phone, an Oscal model C80. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>.</p>

<p>As I write this, I am not sure where this blog is going to go, it’s early days.</p>

<p>I will be posting pictures I take now, and pictures I have taken in the past.</p>

<p>I would also like to provide a commentary about some of the photos, sort of photojournalism.</p>

<p>It will also contain posts about my travels and the various non-software related things I get up to.</p>
